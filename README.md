# fibonacci_sequence
![Image Hover Text](/fib.png)

The Fibonacci Sequence, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.

Your Task
Write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence. Use iteration for this solution.
Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you're crazy, but don't consider either of these lengths a requirement... just get it done).
